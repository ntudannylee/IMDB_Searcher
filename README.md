# IMDB_Searcher
I've build a JavaScript &amp; jQuery IMDB Movie Info Website while geting RESTful API from an open API source called OMDB.

[IMPORTANT]

I can't demonstrate my IMDB_Searcher though github page because:
The page at '<URL>' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint '<URL>'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

[SOLUTION]

Download the full desktop and click index.html to get started!
